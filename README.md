# Tragic References

> Warning:
> This repository is a work in progress and largely intended for aware usage. Open source consumption should be limited to understanding the implementation and not for usage unless of course you are aware of the surrounding process.

This repository contains the type-safe references and declarations of shared constants for Tragic repositories.

The purpose of this submodule is intended to provide a single source of truth for shared constants and references. This is to prevent the need to copy and paste values between repositories, which can lead to inconsistencies and bugs.

With this implementation one can open a single pull request to update a constant or reference across all Tragic repositories without polluting the commit history of each repository.
